# StartMySRB2
Yet another one of those launchers.

 - Automatically saves last executable used upon selecting a valid .exe.
	 - This stays between each launch of the application. To clear it out, double-click on the textbox with the file path while holding down SHIFT.
 - Built with .NET Framework 2.0, this launcher can be ran on Windows 98 or ME provided you installed it there first.
 - SRB2Kart can be started from this as well. Older versions of SRB2 can be also selected for launch.
	 - Latter can be useful if you use this on a Windows 98/ME system.
 - Addon list supports drag'n'drop, as well as reordering of the load order.
	 - This will only accept **.pk3**, **.wad**, **.lua** and **.soc** files. In addition, **srb2.pk3** and **zones.pk3** will always be excluded from being in the list as modern versions of SRB2 already load that by default anyway. ~~Might remove this lock later, not sure.~~
